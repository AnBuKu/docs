debops.smstools
###############



This is an Ansible role which configures `smstools`_ package and sets up
a TCP -> SMS and mail -> SMS gateway. This role has been tested on Debian
and should work on Debian-based systems.

Several other roles from `DebOps`_ project are used to configure various
parts of the SMS gateway (``debops.postfix`` role is used to create mail ->
SMS gateway, ``debops.etc_services``, ``debops.ferm`` and
``debops.tcpwrappers`` are used to configure TCP service which can be used
by other hosts to send SMS messages over the network).

Detailed usage guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sending a text message from command line
========================================

You can send SMS messages from the host connected to the GSM modem, by running
command:

::

    sudo -u smsd sendsms +00123123123 "Text message"

Your user needs to be in ``sms`` system group or needs to be able to run
``/usr/local/bin/sendsms`` script (for example have admin access).

Sending a text message using TCP service
========================================

SMS messages can be sent remotely using TCP service (by default configured on
port ``9898``). Access to the service is protected using tcpwrappers (via
``xinetd`` service) and iptables firewall.

To send a text message using TCP service, connect to port ``9898`` (by default)
and send string similar to (notice lack of quotation marks):

::

    TEXT +00123123123 Text message

TCP service should respond with text ending with ``250 SMS accepted`` (if
formatting was correct), or ``500 Command not recognized`` (if formatting
was incorrect).

Example telnet session which sends SMS message from a localhost:

::

    $ telnet localhost sms
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    TEXT +00123123123 Text message
    --
    Text: Text message
    To: +00123123123
    250 SMS accepted
    Connection closed by foreign host.

Sending a text message over mail
================================

``debops.smstools`` role configures two subdomains in local Postfix instance:

- ``sms.`` subdomain is responsible for mail to SMS transport, Postfix takes
  mail messages sent to that subdomain and passes them to ``sms`` service
  (configured in ``/etc/postfix/master.cf`` which is a script that parses the
  mail message and sends body of that message to specified recipient using
  ``sendsms`` script;

- ``gsm.`` subdomain is used for aliases which correspond to addresses in the
  ``sms.`` subdomain or groups of aliases in the same subdomain;

To send a SMS message via mail, send a mail to an address
``<+00123123123@sms>`` (on localhost) or ``<+00123123123@sms.example.com>``
(from elsewhere). You can also create mail aliases using
``debops.smstools`` role variables or your configured alias table in format
``<name@gsm>`` (from localhost) or ``<name@gsm.example.com>`` (from
elsewhere) which should correspond to mail addresses outlined previously.
Subject of the mail message will be ignored, and body of the message will
be sent using SMS gateway.

Warning, this role can generate mail backscatter!
=================================================

At the moment, SMTP server is configured by ``debops.smstools`` role to accept mail
messages to subdomains specified above and relay them to ``sms`` transport which
checks if a sender of mail message can send SMS messages through mail. If it
can't, SMTP server receives a reject message and generates a bounce message to
an original sender of the mail, which can be forged, generating `mail backscatter`_.

Because of that risk, at the moment mail -> SMS gateway should be configured on
a separate host behind a trusted mail relay to avoid receiving messages from
unknown mail senders, and should only process mail messages from hosts included
in ``mynetworks`` Postfix configuration variable.

To fix backscatter issue, ``debops.smstools`` role needs to have an
`external Postfix access policy service`_ which will be used by Postfix to
check if a specific mail sender can send SMS messages using the gateway.
Steps to determine that:

- check recipient domain of a mail message,

- if recipient domain is one of the supported subdomains (``sms.`` or ``gsm.``),
  check mail address or domain of the sender against list of allowed
  senders,

- if mail sender can send SMS messages, return ``PERMIT`` (or ``DUNNO`` if
  other checks should be performed),

- if mail sender is not found, return ``REJECT``,

- otherwise (mail recipient not in a supported domain), return ``DUNNO`` to
  allow other checks to perform.

Policy service check should be included in ``smtpd_recipient_restrictions`` list
to be able to check both recipient and sender addresses.

Known bugs
==========

- ``sendsms`` script supports sending SMS messages in UTF-8, but ``sms-service``
  and ``sms-transport`` scripts do not, SMS messages are truncated at first
  UTF-8 character.
