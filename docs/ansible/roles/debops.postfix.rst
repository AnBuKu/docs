debops.postfix
##############



This role installs and manages `Postfix`_, an SMTP server.

``debops.postfix`` role is designed to manage Postfix on different hosts in
a cluster, with different "capabilities". At the moment role can configure
Postfix to act as:

* a null client: Postfix sends all mail to another system specified
  either via DNS MX records or an Ansible variable, no local mail is enabled
  (this is the default configuration);
* a local SMTP server: local mail is delivered to local user accounts;
* a network SMTP server: network access is enabled separately from other
  capabilities, to avoid exposing misconfigured SMTP server by mistake and
  becoming an open relay;
* an incoming MX gateway: Postfix will listen on the port 25 (default SMTP
  port) and process connections using ``postscreen`` daemon with automatic
  greylisting and optional RBL checking;
* an outgoing SMTP client: Postfix will relay outgoing mail messages to
  specified remote MX hosts, you can optionally enable SMTP client
  authentication, passwords will be stored separate from the inventory in
  ``secret/`` directory (see ``debops.secret`` role). Sender dependent
  authentication is also available.

More "capabilities" like user authentication, support for virtual mail,
spam/virus filtering and others will be implemented in the future.

This role can also be used as a dependency of other roles which then can
enable more features of the Postfix SMTP server for their own use. For
example, ``debops.mailman`` role enables mail forwarding to the configured
mailing lists, and ``debops.smstools`` role uses Postfix as mail-SMS gateway.

Detailed usage guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of Postfix capabilities in ``postfix`` variable - what Postfix can and
should do on a host. Set this to ``False`` and disable Postfix support, set it
to ``[]`` and have Ansible not do anything with Postfix (unsupported). Not all
combinations of these capabilities will work correctly (role is still in
beta stage).

- ``null``: Postfix has no local delivery, all mail is sent to a MX for current
  domain. Configuration similar to that presented here:
  http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html#null_client
  Default. You should remove this capability and replace it with others
  presented below.

- ``local``: local delivery is enabled on current host.

- ``network``: enables access to Postfix-related ports (``25``, ``587``,
  ``465``) in firewall, required for incoming mail to be acceped by
  Postfix.

- ``mx``: enables support for incoming mail on port ``25``, designed for hosts set up
  as MX. Automatically enables ``postscreen`` (without ``dnsbl``/``dnswl`` support),
  anti-spam restrictions.

- ``submission``: enables authorized mail submission on ports ``25`` and
  ``587`` (user authentication is currently not supported and needs to be
  configured separately).

- ``deprecated``: designed to enable obsolete functions of mail system,
  currently enables authorized mail submission on port ``465`` (when
  ``submission`` is also present in the list of capabilities).

- ``client``: enable SASL authentication for SMTP client (for outgoing mail
  messages sent via relayhosts that require user authentication).

- ``sender_dependent``: enable sender dependent SMTP client authentication
  (``client`` capability required)

- ``archive``: BCC all mail (or mail from/to specified domains) passing
  through the SMTP server to an e-mail account on local or remote server.

- ``postscreen``: allows to enable postscreen support on port ``25``
  independently of ``mx`` capability.

- ``dnsbl``: enables support for DNS blacklists in postscreen, automatically
  enables whitelists.

- ``dnswl``: enables support for DNS whitelists in postscreen, without blacklists.

- ``test``: enables "soft_bounce" option and XCLIENT protocol extension for
  localhost (useful in mail system testing).

- ``defer``: planned feature to defer mail delivery.

- ``auth``: planned feature to enable user authentication.
