debops.tcpwrappers
##################



This role can be used to manage `TCP Wrappers`_ rules located in
``/etc/hosts.allow`` (by default all hosts will be denied access in
``/etc/hosts.deny``, but this can be disabled by a variable).

Other roles can use this role as a dependency to manage access to their own
services (for example, ``debops.mysql``, ``debops.sshd``).

By default, tcpwrappers will be configured to block access from everywhere
except ``localhost`` (relative to remote host) and Ansible Controller.
