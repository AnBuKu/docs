debops.redis
############



``debops.redis`` role allows you to easily setup infrastructure capable of
running and managing 1 or more Redis servers. It is completely self healing
with Redis Sentinel and supports replication seamlessly.

Few features available in this role:

- seamless master/slave replication;
- throw together a master + n slaves + n sentinel setup in about 10 lines of YAML
  (most of those lines would be adding your hosts to the inventory);
- your configs are idempotent, even when redis rewrites them;
- pretty much every redis config value is tweakable;
- you can easily use this role as a dependency in your other roles;

Detailed usage guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is the bare minimum to get started to setup a few Redis servers
acting together. If all you want to do is use Redis as a single server
dependency in another role then include the role in your role's meta main
file. You don't have to add the groups in your inventory in that case.

inventory/hosts
===============

::

    # In this example the 'redis-server0' host would be the redis
    # master and everything else would be a slave of that master.
    [debops_redis]
    redis-server0
    redis-server1
    redis-server2

    # You can have 1 or more sentinels. The sentinel(s) will control your master
    # and slave relationships.
    [debops_redis_sentinel]
    redis-monitor

inventory/group_vars/debops_redis_sentinel.yml
==============================================

::

    # It is expected that you have a firewall configured with 'debops.ferm'
    # role, set up to block all ports. Variables below tell Redis role to
    # accept connections from anywhere and then whitelist your local
    # network to allow connections to it.
    redis_sentinel_bind: ['0.0.0.0']
    redis_sentinel_allow: ['192.168.0.0/16']

inventory/group_vars/debops_redis.yml
=====================================

::

    # This setup allows you to grant access to your redis servers from your
    # application group and the sentinel group. You can add as many hosts
    # as you need.
    redis_bind: ['0.0.0.0']
    redis_server_allow: '{{ groups["your_web_apps"] + redis_sentinel_hosts_group }}'

If you want a Sentinel server to also act as a Redis server you can combine
the 2 iservices on 1 host. You will need to set ``redis_sentinel_standalone: False``
in that host's inventory. This is covered in the ``defaults/main.yml`` file.

You don't need to define a playbook unless you want to use group names other
than the default. If you use non-default group names then make sure you
change the defaults in your inventory.

Running the playbook
====================

::

    debops -t redis
