debops.mailman
##############


Install and configure `Mailman`_, a mailing list manager. It will be
installed behind `Postfix`_ server (using ``debops.postfix`` role) which
will serve as an incoming/outgoing mail server, and `nginx`_ server (with
help of ``debops.nginx`` role) will serve the web interface. You can also
use this role to create or remove mailing lists themselves (other
management can be done using the web interface).

Detailed usage guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mailman is a bit tricky to manage idempotently - there are many patches
applied during first install, mailing lists are hard to change once they
are created and there might be issues with upgrading of configuration files
(because of that ``mailman`` is not upgraded automatically by default).
I suggest that you prepare your Mailman configuration in development
environment, and apply it in production when it's ready.

Postfix will configure Mailman integration differently depending on it's
enabled capabilities:

- with ``local`` capability Postfix will pass mail messages to Mailman
  using mail aliases and ``virtual_alias_maps``/``virtual_alias_domains``;

- without ``local`` capability Postfix will pass mail messages to Mailman
  using ``postfix-to-mailman.py`` script, ``relay_recipient_maps``,
  ``relay_recipient_domains`` and ``transport_maps``;
